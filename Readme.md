## Description
This project is about building an environment with planets to simulate the Sun – Earth – model 
Moon. The background will be black with stars in random places. The Sun should be located 
in the center of the stage. The Earth will revolve around the Sun and around itself. The
Moon will revolve around the Earth.

## Specifications
- The three planets can be constructed with helper files of type .obj.
- The Sun should illuminate the entire scene. Therefore, you will need a light source to  Sun which will diffuse the light in all directions.
- The stars will not radiate.
- There should be interaction with the user. Your program should supports the following functions:
    - Rotate the camera along the X and Y axes via 4 keys (2 keys for X axis, 2 keys for Y axis).
    - Pause/start movement, via key.
    - Close program via key
